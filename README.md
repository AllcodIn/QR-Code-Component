### What I learned

This challenge allows me to know how to constraint content width to a certain range and improve my knowledge about responsive design.

```css
main {
    max-width: -moz-fit-content;
    max-width: fit-content;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 1440px){
    main{
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about responsive design because it took me too much time in this project.
